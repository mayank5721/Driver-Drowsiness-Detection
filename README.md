# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
This repository contains the code for a driver drowsiness detection project. The project aims to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using computer vision techniques and deep learning.
 It utilizes OpenCV for face and eye detection, and Keras for building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for drowsiness classification.
 
 The provided code sets up the model architecture, loads the trained model weights, and performs real-time drowsiness detection based on the eye state predictions.

Feel free to explore and use this repository as a starting point for your driver drowsiness detection project.
